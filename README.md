# sphinxcontrib-jupyter.minimal

A Minimal Example of the Jupyter Sphinx Extension

This is a minimal example of a Sphinx project that is setup
to use the `Jupyter Extension<https://github.com/QuantEcon/sphinxcontrib-jupyter>`__.

This requires you to install the extension:

    pip install sphinxcontrib-jupyter

Once cloned you should be able to run:

    make jupyter

to generate a small set of demo jupyter notebooks.
